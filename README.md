This is one of the assignments for the Database and SQL course. In this assignment, the topics covered are Aggregate Functions and Scalar Functions. Aggregate Functions are used to perform operations on data sets, such as calculating the total sum, average, maximum value, and minimum value. Scalar Functions, on the other hand, are used to perform operations on individual values, such as string or number manipulation.
